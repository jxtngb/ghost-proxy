# Ghost Proxy

Ghost Proxy is a Go-based SOCKS5 proxy system that establishes an authenticated encrypted connection between a local client and a gateway. The gateway validates the session and forwards the requested TCP connection to a controlled destination.

## Current architecture

```text
Application
    |
    v
Local SOCKS5 client (127.0.0.1:1080)
    |
    | SOCKS5 CONNECT
    v
Ghost client
    |
    | TLS 1.3 + authenticated Ghost protocol
    v
Ghost gateway/server
    |
    | authenticated destination forwarding
    v
Controlled TCP destination
```

## Implemented components

- SOCKS5 client/server handling
- TLS 1.3 transport using uTLS
- TLS exporter based session material
- PSK-based authentication
- HKDF key derivation
- HMAC authentication
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption
- Framed encrypted data transport
- Traffic padding
- Gateway destination forwarding
- Authentication-success acknowledgement
- Actual client/server configuration E2E test
- Incorrect-PSK rejection test
- Go unit/integration tests and CI

## Requirements

- Go toolchain compatible with the version declared by `go.mod`
- OpenSSL for local certificate generation
- TLS certificate and private key for the gateway
- Shared hexadecimal PSK in `GHOST_PSK` (see PSK setup — obtained from the maintainer, not self-generated)

## Configuration

### Server

```yaml
listen_address: "0.0.0.0:443"
log_level: "info"
cert_file: "configs/server.crt"
key_file: "configs/server.key"
```

For local development, `Start_server.SH` starts the server on `127.0.0.1:8443`.

### Client

Default reference:

```yaml
listen_address: "127.0.0.1:1080"
server_address: "127.0.0.1:443"
server_name: "localhost"
ca_file: "server.crt"
log_level: "info"
fallback_address: ""
padding_enabled: true
jitter_ms: 0
```

For local launcher testing:

```yaml
listen_address: "127.0.0.1:1080"
server_address: "127.0.0.1:8443"
server_name: "localhost"
ca_file: "server.crt"
log_level: "info"
fallback_address: ""
padding_enabled: true
jitter_ms: 0
```

## PSK setup

Ghost Proxy uses **one shared PSK for the whole deployment** — the server and every client use the identical key. It is generated and rotated only by the project maintainer, not by individual users. If you need to connect, request the current PSK from the maintainer rather than generating your own — a self-generated key will not match the server and the handshake will fail.

The PSK must be hexadecimal and decode to at least 16 bytes (32 bytes / 64 hex characters recommended).

Once you have the key, create a local `ghost.env` file:

```text
GHOST_PSK=<the key the maintainer gave you>
```

Restrict its permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 ghost.env
```

Never commit `ghost.env`, production PSKs, private keys, or certificates.

> **Maintainer only — generating or rotating the PSK:**
> ```bash
> openssl rand -hex 32
> ```
> After rotating, the new key must be redistributed to every client out of
> band (not via git, not via this README) before the old key is retired.

> **Design note:** a single shared PSK means any compromise affects every
> client equally, and individual clients cannot be distinguished or revoked
> separately. This is an intentional trade-off for a small, trusted,
> centrally-maintained deployment — not a gap. Per-client PSKs or
> certificate-based (mTLS) auth are possible future work if the deployment
> grows beyond that scope.

## TLS certificate

For local development, generate the test certificate with:

```bash
sh tests/gen-certs.sh
```

Or manually, including a Subject Alternative Name (required by modern TLS clients):

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout configs/server.key -out configs/server.crt \
  -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=localhost" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1"
```

The certificate and key should be:

```text
configs/server.crt
configs/server.key
```

With `ca_file: "server.crt"` in `configs/client.yaml`, the client resolves the CA relative to the configuration directory — do not prefix it with `configs/` or the client will look for a duplicated, nonexistent path.

TLS certificate verification remains enabled.

## Local quick start

The repository includes launcher scripts for simplified local client/server testing.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Start_server.SH` | Starts `ghost-server` on `127.0.0.1:8443` |
| `Start_client.SH` | Starts `ghost-client` |
| `start-client.bat` | Starts `ghost-client` on Windows |

### 1. Build

From the repository root:

```bash
go build -o ghost-server ./cmd/server
go build -o ghost-client ./cmd/client
```

### 2. Create `ghost.env`

```text
GHOST_PSK=<the key the maintainer gave you>
```

Keep it local — see PSK setup above.

### 3. Configure the client

Edit `configs/client.yaml`:

```yaml
listen_address: "127.0.0.1:1080"
server_address: "127.0.0.1:8443"
server_name: "localhost"
ca_file: "server.crt"
```

### 4. Start the server

Linux/macOS:

```bash
bash ./Start_server.SH
```

Windows:

```powershell
.\ghost-server.exe -listen 127.0.0.1:8443
```

### 5. Start the client

Linux/macOS:

```bash
bash ./Start_client.SH
```

Windows:

```bat
start-client.bat
```

The SOCKS5 listener is available on `127.0.0.1:1080`.

### 6. Test

```bash
curl --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:1080 https://example.com -I
```

A successful request should return an HTTP status such as:

```text
HTTP/2 200
```

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `syntax error near unexpected token 'newline'` loading `ghost.env` | Stray characters in the file — check with `cat -A ghost.env` |
| `connect: connection refused` on port 443 | `client.yaml`'s `server_address` port doesn't match the port the server actually bound to (e.g. still `:443` instead of `:8443`) |
| `read CA certificate: ... configs/configs/server.crt: no such file` | `ca_file` in `client.yaml` has a redundant `configs/` prefix — it should just be `server.crt` |
| `load TLS certificate: ... no such file or directory` | Cert/key haven't been generated yet — see TLS certificate above |

## Build and regression

```bash
go test ./...
go build ./...
go vet ./...
```

Windows E2E:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tests\e2e-actual-config.ps1
```

Linux E2E:

```bash
sh tests/e2e-linux.sh
```

A successful Windows E2E run ends with:

```text
ACTUAL-CONFIG E2E TEST: PASS
```

## Nginx deployment

The repository includes a separately configured Nginx service for controlled deployment/testing.

```text
deployments/nginx/
├── Dockerfile
├── nginx.conf
├── index.html
└── README.md
```

Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t ghost-proxy-nginx ./deployments/nginx
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghost-proxy-nginx
```

Verify:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

The health endpoint should return:

```text
ghost-nginx-ok
```

## Performance profiling

The gateway's pprof server is disabled by default.

Enable it with:

```yaml
pprof_address: "127.0.0.1:6060"
```

Configuration rejects non-loopback profiling addresses.

See `docs/performance.md`.

## Project verification status

CI runs formatting, `go vet`, `staticcheck`, build, and race-enabled tests.

Baseline checks include:

```text
go test ./... -count=1
go build ./...
go vet ./...
native fuzz smoke tests
docker compose -f deployments/compose.yml config --quiet
```

See `CHANGES.md` for detailed verification results and known limitations.

## Development workflow

Use feature branches:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>
```

After implementation:

```bash
go test ./...
go build ./...
go vet ./...
git status --short --branch
git add <intended-files>
git commit -m "type: describe the change"
git push -u origin <type>/<short-description>
```

Open a pull request against `main`.

## Security notes

- Never commit production PSKs or private TLS keys.
- Never commit `ghost.env`.
- Only the maintainer generates or rotates the PSK; others request it rather than generating their own.
- The deployment uses a single shared PSK across all clients by design — this is suitable for a small, trusted, centrally-maintained setup but does not provide per-client accountability or revocation.
- Keep TLS certificate verification enabled.
- Restrict gateway destination access according to the deployment trust boundary.
- Use controlled destinations for testing.
